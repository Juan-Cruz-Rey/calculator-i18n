# Pregnancy Calculator - Calculate Your Due Date & Pregnancy Week

Our **free pregnancy calculator** helps you estimate your due date, current pregnancy week, and important pregnancy milestones. Get comprehensive information about your baby's development and key dates throughout your pregnancy journey.

## What is a Pregnancy Calculator?

A **pregnancy calculator** is a tool that estimates your expected due date (EDD) and current gestational age based on either your last menstrual period (LMP) or conception date. It provides a detailed pregnancy timeline including trimester breakdown, important milestones, and fetal development stages.

### How Pregnancy Dates Are Calculated

Pregnancy dating typically uses the **first day of your last menstrual period (LMP)** as the starting point, even though conception usually occurs about two weeks later. This standard method is used worldwide by healthcare providers.

**Standard Calculation:**
- Full-term pregnancy: 40 weeks (280 days) from LMP
- Conception typically occurs: 14 days after LMP (ovulation)
- Actual fetal age: About 2 weeks less than gestational age

## Understanding Your Pregnancy Timeline

### Gestational Age vs. Fetal Age

**Gestational Age:**
- Counted from the first day of your last menstrual period
- Used by doctors and healthcare providers
- Typically 2 weeks longer than fetal age
- What pregnancy weeks and due dates are based on

**Fetal Age (Conceptional Age):**
- Counted from actual conception/fertilization
- Usually about 2 weeks after LMP
- Actual age of the developing baby
- Less commonly used in medical practice

### Pregnancy Trimesters

| Trimester | Weeks | Key Developments |
|-----------|-------|------------------|
| **First Trimester** | 1-13 weeks | Major organs form, heartbeat begins, morning sickness common |
| **Second Trimester** | 14-27 weeks | Baby movements felt, gender can be determined, energy often returns |
| **Third Trimester** | 28-40+ weeks | Rapid weight gain, baby's lungs mature, preparing for birth |

## Due Date Accuracy and Variations

### How Accurate Are Due Dates?

**Reality of Due Dates:**
- Only 5% of babies are born on their exact due date
- 80% are born within 2 weeks of the due date
- 95% are born within 3 weeks of the due date
- Due dates are estimates, not guarantees

### Factors Affecting Due Date

**Irregular Menstrual Cycles:**
- LMP-based calculations less accurate
- Early ultrasound provides better dating
- Conception date (if known) improves accuracy

**First vs. Subsequent Pregnancies:**
- First-time mothers: More likely to deliver after 40 weeks
- Subsequent pregnancies: Often deliver earlier
- Average difference: 3-5 days

**Multiple Gestations:**
- Twins average birth: 35-37 weeks
- Triplets average birth: 32-34 weeks
- Higher multiples: Even earlier delivery typical

### When Due Dates Change

**Early Ultrasound (Before 13 Weeks):**
- Most accurate method for dating
- Can adjust LMP-based due date
- Accurate within 5-7 days
- Measurement based on crown-rump length

**Later Ultrasounds:**
- Less accurate for dating (variation in fetal growth)
- Not typically used to change established due dates
- Better for monitoring growth and development

## Conception Date Calculation

### Estimating Conception Date

If you know your conception date:
- Due date = Conception date + 266 days (38 weeks)
- This is more accurate than LMP for irregular cycles

If you don't know conception date:
- Estimated conception = LMP + 14 days
- Assumes ovulation occurred mid-cycle
- Works best for regular 28-day cycles

### Conception Window

**Fertile Window:**
- Sperm can survive: 5 days in female reproductive tract
- Egg viable for: 12-24 hours after ovulation
- Fertile window: 6 days ending on ovulation day
- Most fertile days: 2-3 days before ovulation

**Conception Timing:**
- Intercourse 1-2 days before ovulation: Highest conception chance
- Day of ovulation: High conception chance
- After ovulation: Rapidly decreasing chance

## Pregnancy Week Calculation Methods

### Method 1: From Last Menstrual Period (LMP)

**Most Common Method:**
1. Identify the first day of your last period
2. Count forward 40 weeks (280 days)
3. Result is your estimated due date
4. Current week = days since LMP ÷ 7

**Example:**
- LMP: January 1, 2026
- Due date: October 8, 2026 (40 weeks later)
- If today is March 1: You're 8 weeks, 4 days pregnant

### Method 2: From Conception Date

**If Known:**
1. Identify conception date
2. Add 38 weeks (266 days)
3. Result is your estimated due date
4. Current week = days since conception ÷ 7 + 2 weeks

**Example:**
- Conception date: January 15, 2026
- Due date: October 8, 2026 (38 weeks later)
- Gestational age = fetal age + 2 weeks

### Method 3: From Ultrasound Dating

**Most Accurate:**
- First-trimester ultrasound (before 13 weeks)
- Measures crown-rump length
- Establishes "ultrasound due date"
- Typically becomes the official due date

## Pregnancy Symptoms by Week

### Early Pregnancy (Weeks 1-8)

- Missed period (usually first sign)
- Breast tenderness and swelling
- Fatigue and exhaustion
- Morning sickness (nausea/vomiting)
- Frequent urination

- Mild cramping
- Light spotting (implantation bleeding)

### Mid-Pregnancy (Weeks 9-27)

**Symptoms:**
- Energy typically returns (second trimester)
- Morning sickness usually subsides
- Baby movements felt ("quickening")
- Growing belly becomes visible
- Skin changes (linea nigra, darkened nipples)
- Nasal congestion
- Heartburn and indigestion
- Round ligament pain

### Late Pregnancy (Weeks 28-40+)

**Symptoms:**
- Increased fatigue
- Shortness of breath
- Braxton Hicks contractions
- Swelling in feet and ankles

- "Nesting" instinct
- Pelvic pressure

## Term Classifications

### Pregnancy Term Definitions

| Classification | Weeks | Implications |
|---------------|-------|--------------|
| **Early Term** | 37-38 weeks, 6 days | Baby's lungs may still be maturing |
| **Full Term** | 39-40 weeks, 6 days | Optimal time for delivery |
| **Late Term** | 41-41 weeks, 6 days | Slightly increased monitoring |
| **Post Term** | 42+ weeks | Induction often considered |

**Preterm Categories:**
- Extremely preterm: Before 28 weeks
- Very preterm: 28-32 weeks
- Moderate preterm: 32-34 weeks
- Late preterm: 34-37 weeks

### Why Full Term Matters

**39-40 Weeks Optimal Because:**
- Brain development continues through week 39
- Lungs fully mature
- Better temperature regulation
- Lower NICU admission rates
- Better feeding success
- Reduced respiratory problems

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I calculate my pregnancy week?

Count from the first day of your last menstrual period (LMP). Each complete 7-day period equals one week. For example, if your LMP was 63 days ago, you're 9 weeks pregnant (63 ÷ 7 = 9).

### Can my due date change?

Yes. Your due date may be adjusted based on early ultrasound measurements (before 13 weeks), which are more accurate than LMP-based calculations. Once established by early ultrasound, the due date rarely changes.

### What if I don't remember my last period?

An early ultrasound (ideally before 13 weeks) can accurately date your pregnancy. The ultrasound measures the embryo's size to determine gestational age and calculate your due date.

### Are pregnancy weeks counted from conception?

No. Pregnancy weeks are counted from the first day of your last menstrual period, not from conception. This means you're considered "2 weeks pregnant" at the time of conception.

### How accurate is a pregnancy calculator?

Pregnancy calculators provide estimates accurate within 1-2 weeks for women with regular cycles. Early ultrasound dating is more accurate (within 5-7 days). Only about 5% of babies arrive on their exact due date.

### What's the difference between gestational age and fetal age?

Gestational age is counted from your last menstrual period (what doctors use). Fetal age is counted from conception, typically 2 weeks less than gestational age. For example, at "8 weeks gestational age," the fetus is about 6 weeks old.

### When does each trimester begin?

First trimester: Weeks 1-13; Second trimester: Weeks 14-27; Third trimester: Weeks 28-40+. Some sources vary slightly, but these are the most commonly used ranges.

### Can I calculate my due date from conception date?

Yes. Add 266 days (38 weeks) to your conception date to estimate your due date. This method is accurate if you know your exact conception date.

### How long is a full-term pregnancy?

A full-term pregnancy is considered 39-40 weeks and 6 days from your last menstrual period. However, anywhere from 37-42 weeks is considered term, with 39-40 weeks being optimal for baby's development.

### What week does pregnancy start showing?

First-time mothers typically show between 12-16 weeks. Experienced mothers may show earlier, around 8-12 weeks. Factors include body type, fitness level, and number of previous pregnancies.
