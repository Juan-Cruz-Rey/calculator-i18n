# Period Calculator - Track Your Menstrual Cycle & Predict Next Period

Our **free period calculator** helps you predict when your next period will start, track your menstrual cycle patterns, and identify your fertile window. Get accurate predictions based on your cycle history and plan ahead with confidence.

## What is a Period Calculator?

A **period calculator** (or menstrual cycle calculator) predicts your next period start date based on your last period and average cycle length. It helps you track patterns, anticipate menstruation, plan activities, and identify fertile days for conception or contraception purposes.

### Why Track Your Menstrual Cycle?

**Health Monitoring:**
- Detect irregular cycles that may indicate health issues
- Identify patterns in symptoms (PMS, cramps, mood)
- Track fertility for conception planning
- Monitor hormonal health

**Practical Planning:**
- Plan vacations, events, and activities
- Prepare with menstrual products
- Anticipate PMS symptoms
- Manage birth control timing

## Understanding the Menstrual Cycle

### The Four Phases

**Phase 1: Menstruation (Days 1-5)**
- Period bleeding occurs
- Uterine lining sheds
- Hormone levels at lowest
- Duration: 3-7 days (average 5 days)

**Phase 2: Follicular Phase (Days 1-13)**
- Overlaps with menstruation
- Follicles develop in ovaries
- Estrogen levels rise
- Uterine lining rebuilds
- Energy and mood typically improve

**Phase 3: Ovulation (Day 14)**
- Mature egg released from ovary
- Most fertile time of cycle
- LH surge triggers egg release
- Lasts approximately 24 hours
- Occurs ~14 days before next period

**Phase 4: Luteal Phase (Days 15-28)**
- After ovulation until next period
- Corpus luteum produces progesterone
- Uterine lining thickens
- PMS symptoms may appear
- Duration: Typically 14 days (consistent)

### Cycle Length Variations

**What's Normal?**

| Cycle Length | Classification | Percentage of Women |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **21-24 days** | Short | 15% |
| **25-27 days** | Slightly short | 20% |
| **28-30 days** | Average | 35% |
| **31-34 days** | Slightly long | 20% |
| **35-40 days** | Long | 10% |

**Average Cycle:** 28 days (but 21-35 days is normal)
**Period Duration:** 3-7 days (average 5 days)
**Cycle Regularity:** Varies by 2-3 days month to month is normal

## How to Calculate Your Next Period

### Simple Method

**Formula:**
Last Period Start Date + Cycle Length = Next Period Date

**Example:**
- Last period: January 1
- Cycle length: 28 days
- Next period: January 29 (1 + 28)

### Tracking for Accuracy

**For Regular Cycles:**
1. Track your last 3-6 cycles
2. Calculate average cycle length
3. Add to last period start date
4. Result is predicted next period

**Example Calculation:**
- Cycle 1: 28 days
- Cycle 2: 30 days
- Cycle 3: 27 days
- Average: 28.3 days (round to 28)

**For Irregular Cycles:**
- Track minimum and maximum cycle length
- Predict earliest and latest possible start dates
- Be prepared across wider window

### Digital Tracking Tools

**Period Tracking Apps:**
- Flo, Clue, Period Tracker
- Automatic calculations
- Symptom logging
- Fertility predictions
- Cycle pattern analysis

**Calendar Method:**
- Mark first day of each period
- Count days between periods
- Identify average cycle length
- Predict next cycle

## Period Calendar and Tracking

### What to Track

**Essential Data:**
- First day of period (Day 1)
- Last day of period
- Flow intensity (light, medium, heavy)
- Cycle length (days from Day 1 to next Day 1)

**Optional but Helpful:**
- PMS symptoms and timing
- Menstrual cramps severity
- Mood changes
- Breast tenderness
- Bloating
- Food cravings
- Energy levels
- Sexual desire changes

### Creating Your Period Calendar

**Month 1:**
1. Mark first day of period as Day 1
2. Track daily until period ends
3. Note flow and symptoms

**Month 2+:**
1. Count days since last Day 1
2. This number is your cycle length
3. Predict next period
4. Verify accuracy when period arrives

**After 3-6 Months:**
- Calculate average cycle length
- Identify pattern consistency
- Note any irregularities
- Improve future predictions

## Fertile Window and Ovulation

### Predicting Fertile Days

**From Your Period:**
- Ovulation typically occurs 14 days before next period
- For 28-day cycle: Ovulation on day 14
- For 30-day cycle: Ovulation on day 16
- For 35-day cycle: Ovulation on day 21

**Fertile Window:**
- 5 days before ovulation
- Ovulation day itself
- Total: 6 days of possible conception

### Cycle Day Fertility Chart

**For 28-Day Cycle:**

| Days | Phase | Fertility |
|------|-------|-----------|
| **1-7** | Menstruation | Not fertile |
| **8-9** | Post-period | Low fertility |
| **10-14** | Pre-ovulation | High fertility |
| **15** | Ovulation day | Peak fertility |
| **16-28** | Post-ovulation | Not fertile |

**Pregnancy Probability:**
- Days 10-12: 10-15% chance
- Days 13-14: 20-30% chance
- Day 15 (ovulation): 20-25% chance
- Days 16+: {'<'}5% chance

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I calculate my next period?

Add your average cycle length to the first day of your last period. For example, if your last period started January 1 and your cycle is 28 days, your next period should start around January 29.

### What is a normal period cycle length?

A normal menstrual cycle is anywhere from 21-35 days, measured from the first day of one period to the first day of the next. The average is 28 days, but variation of 2-3 days month to month is completely normal.

### How accurate are period calculators?

Period calculators are 80-90% accurate for women with regular cycles, predicting within 1-3 days. Accuracy decreases with irregular cycles. Tracking for 3-6 months improves prediction accuracy.

### Can stress delay my period?

Yes. Severe or prolonged stress can delay ovulation, which delays your period. The delay can range from a few days to several weeks. Once the stressful period passes, cycles typically normalize.

### Why is my period late if I'm not pregnant?

Common reasons include stress, significant weight changes, excessive exercise, illness, hormonal imbalances (thyroid, PCOS), medications, or irregular ovulation. If your period is more than 5-7 days late and you're not pregnant, consider seeing a doctor.

### How many days late can a period be before worrying?

A period can be 5-7 days late occasionally without concern, especially if you've experienced stress or lifestyle changes. If your period is more than a week late and you're not pregnant, or if irregular periods become a pattern, consult a healthcare provider.

### What is considered a heavy period?

Heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) is defined as soaking through a pad or tampon every 1-2 hours, needing to change protection during the night, passing large blood clots (larger than a quarter), or bleeding lasting more than 7 days.

### Can I get pregnant on my period?

It's unlikely but possible, especially if you have short cycles (21-24 days). Sperm can survive up to 5 days, so if you ovulate early (day 7-10), intercourse during your period could result in pregnancy.

### How do I know if my cycle is irregular?

Your cycle is considered irregular if it consistently varies by more than 7-9 days, is shorter than 21 days, longer than 35 days, you skip periods, or you bleed between periods. Occasional variation of 2-3 days is normal.

### At what age do periods stop?

Periods typically stop between ages 45-55, with the average age being 51. This is called menopause. The transition period (perimenopause) can begin in the early-to-mid 40s and lasts 4-8 years on average.
