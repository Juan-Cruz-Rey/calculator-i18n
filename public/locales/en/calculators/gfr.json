  "about": {
    "title": "About the GFR Calculator",
    "description": "The Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) calculator estimates how well your kidneys are filtering waste from your blood. It's a key indicator of kidney health and is used to detect and monitor chronic kidney disease (CKD).",
    "whatIsGFR": "What is GFR?",
    "gfrExplanation": "GFR measures how much blood passes through the glomeruli (tiny filters in the kidneys) each minute. A normal GFR is 90 or above. A GFR below 60 for three months or more indicates chronic kidney disease. The lower the GFR, the worse the kidney function.",
    "ckdEpiEquation": "CKD-EPI Equation",
    "equationExplanation": "The CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) equation is the most widely used method for estimating GFR. The 2021 version removed race as a factor, making it more equitable. It uses your age, gender, and serum creatinine level to estimate kidney function.",

    "note1": "This calculator is most accurate for adults 18 years and older",
    "note2": "Results may be less accurate in people with extreme body sizes, severe malnutrition, or muscle diseases",
    "note3": "A single GFR result is not enough to diagnose kidney disease - monitoring over time is important",
    "note4": "Other factors like protein in urine and kidney damage also determine CKD stage"
